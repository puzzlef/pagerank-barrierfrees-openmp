Effect of using different values of tolerance with barrier-free iterations in
[OpenMP]-based ordered [PageRank algorithm] for [link analysis].

**Unordered PageRank** is the *standard* approach of PageRank computation (as
described in the original paper by Larry Page et al. [(1)]), where *two*
*different rank vectors* are maintained; one representing the *current* ranks of
vertices, and the other representing the *previous* ranks. On the other hand,
**ordered PageRank** uses *a single rank vector*, representing the current ranks
of vertices [(2)]. This is similar to barrierless non-blocking implementations
of the PageRank algorithm by Hemalatha Eedi et al. [(3)]. As ranks are updated
in the same vector (with each iteration), the order in which vertices are
processed *affects* the final result (hence the adjective *ordered*). However,
as PageRank is an iteratively converging algorithm, results obtained with either
approach are *mostly the same*. **Barrier-free PageRank** is an *ordered*
*PageRank* where each thread processes a subset of vertices in the graph
independently, *without* waiting (with a barrier) for other threads to complete an
iteration. This minimizes unnecessary waits and allows each thread to be on a
*different iteration number* (which may or may not be beneficial for convergence)
[(3)].

In this experiment, we perform two diffrent approaches of barrier-free
iterations of *OpenMP-based ordered PageRank*; one in which each thread detects
convergence by measuring the difference between the previous and the current
ranks of all the vertices (**full**), and the other in which the difference is
measured between the previous and current ranks of only the subset of vertices
being processed by each thread (**part**). This is done while adjusting the
tolerance `τ` from `10^-1` to `10^-14` with three different tolerance functions:
`L1-norm`, `L2-norm`, and `L∞-norm`. We also compare it with OpenMP-based
unordered and ordered PageRank for the same tolerance and tolerance function. We
use a damping factor of `α = 0.85` and limit the maximum number of iterations to
`L = 500`. The error between the approaches is calculated with *L1-norm*. The
*sequential unordered* approach is considered to be the *gold standard* (wrt to
which error is measured). *Dead ends* in the graph are handled by always
teleporting any vertex in the graph at random (*teleport* approach [(4)]). The
teleport contribution to all vertices is calculated *once* (for all vertices) at
the begining of each iteration.

From the results, we observe that the **partial-error based barrier-free**
**PageRank** is **faster than full-error version**, but generally has **similar**
**performance as that of standard OpenMP-based PageRank (unordered, ordered)**,
although it **requires the fewest iterations to converge**. However the,
**partial barrier-free approach** also **generally yields greater error in**
**ranks** (with respect to sequential unordered approach).

All outputs are saved in a [gist] and a small part of the output is listed here.
Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. The input data
used for this experiment is available from the [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection].
This experiment was done with guidance from [Prof. Kishore Kothapalli],
[Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee], and [Prof. Sathya Peri].
